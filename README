C program exercice to add two files, in this case 
Zadatak1Parcial.c & ZadatakParcial.h .
The whole purpose is to test knowledge of adding 
two external file into one program. 
Zadatak1Parcial.c includes stdio.h and call for 
exernal file, and Zadatak1Parcial.h contains definitions
of the program, etc #define PI 3.13 ( order , parameter ).
It's true that if you compile and build ZadatakParcial.c 
& ZadatakParcial.h they work independently (but linked together
on execution).

The main file Zadatak1.c works as one piece, because 
both files were written in one source code. That was 
all purpouse of exercise.
